                I started my web development journey in the first quarter of 2022 with freeCodeCamp while still living in New Zealand. 
                I picked it back up in September 2022 with Coursera after traveling around Europe for 3 months and moving to the United Kingdom. 
                Once again, I had to put it on the back burner after relocating and starting a new job in December. 
                However, I have since picked web development back up and have been slowly but steadily building my skills in my spare time.
